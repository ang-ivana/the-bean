  <p>
  Americano is a type of coffee drink prepared by diluting an espresso shot with hot water at a 1:3 to 1:4 ratio, 
  resulting in a drink that retains the complex flavors of espresso, <br>
  but in a lighter way.Its strength varies with the number of shots of espresso and the amount of water added. <br>
  <h2> How to make </h2>
  The drink consists of a single shot of espresso mixed with added water. 
  Typically about 120-180 millilitres of hot water mixed with the espresso. <br>
  The hot water can be drawn directly from the machine used to brew the espresso, 
  as water or steam, or from a separate water heater or kettle.
  <h2> Variations of Americano coffee </h2>
  A long black is made in the reverse order, by pouring an espresso shot into hot water. 
  This helps keep the espresso's crema intact. <br>
  The iced americano is made by combining espresso with cold water instead of hot water. <br>
  A red eye is made by combining a shot of espresso with drip coffee instead of hot water, 
  and may be called a shot in the dark. <br>
