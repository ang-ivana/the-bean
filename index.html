    Coffee is always a good idea
    Coffee is the common man's gold, and like gold, it brings to every person the feeling of luxury and nobility.
    You can't buy happiness, but you can buy coffee, and that's pretty close.

  <h2>Cold coffee, warm heart</h2>
  <p>One of my favourite coffees is cold brew, so here's how it works:
    Grind the coffee coarsely, which you can do yourself at home or wherever you buy the beans.
    Combine the grounds with water, then let it steep overnight, or for around 12 hours.
    During this time, the coffee slowly infuses into the water, creating a strong, concentrated brew.
    Strain the next morning, and you're ready to go.
    
    The slow infusion pulls all the great coffee flavor from the beans (and, yes, the caffeine - not to worry!).
    But it also leaves behind most of the compounds that can make coffee taste bitter and sour.
    This means that cold brewed coffee is incredibly smooth and almost sweet-tasting, perfect for iced coffee.
    Cold brewed coffee can be served iced or piping hot, dealer's choice.
    You follow the same method for making the coffee either way, and then either serve it over ice or warm it up in the microwave for a hot cup.
    When warming it for hot coffee, I often add a splash of water to dilute the coffee before warming.
    But this, again, is a matter of personal taste. Enjoy!
